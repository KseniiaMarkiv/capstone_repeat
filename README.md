# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

I created this app for Coursera assignment of 1 week 6 course. I just repeat all commands but at new RoR version.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - "3.0.2"
* Rails version - "7.0.0"

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation 

* Database initialization - "pg"

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

I will added comment in Readme consistently.
